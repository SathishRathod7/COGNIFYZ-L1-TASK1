**Overview of Data Exploration and Preprocessing**

Objectives:           
  1.Understand the Dataset: Gain insights into the structure and content of the dataset by identifying the number of rows and columns.             
  2.Handle Missing Values: Detect and appropriately handle any missing values in the dataset.               
  3.Data Type Conversion: Ensure that all data types are correctly set for effective analysis.                 
  4.Target Variable Analysis: Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identify any class imbalances.               
  
Key Activities:                    
 1.Explore the Dataset:                    
  *Load the dataset into a DataFrame.                     
  *Display the shape of the dataset to determine the number of rows and columns.                         
  *View the first few rows to get an initial understanding of the data.

2.Check for Missing Values:                  
  *Identify columns with missing values.               
  *Determine the percentage of missing values in each column.               
  *Decide on a strategy to handle missing values, such as imputation or removal.

3.Perform Data Type Conversion:               
  *Review the data types of each column.           
  *Convert data types where necessary (e.g., converting strings to dates, objects to categorical types).            
  
 4.Analyze Target Variable:             
  *Visualize the distribution of the "Aggregate rating" using histograms or bar plots.             
  *Identify and handle class imbalances if present (e.g., through resampling techniques).          
  
Technology Used:            

Programming Language:                 
  *Python: A versatile programming language widely used for data analysis and preprocessing.               

Libraries and Tools:               
  *Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, including handling missing values and data type conversions.              
  *NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.            
  *Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.              
  *Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, particularly useful for exploring and understanding the distribution of variables.
